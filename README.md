## INFO
*  1 Used the code from ra1nstorm helper prepares an environment adequate for running checkra1n and exploiting your iOS device in a macOS virtual machine <b>with some changes to skip the installation and reduce the necessary storage.</b> 

* 2 Download a pre-modified DMG image based on MacOSx high sierra that contains checkra1n <b>(not the same as ra1nusb).</b>

* ~~3 The DMG is transferred in USB (minimum 4GB) using balena etcher~~<br> 
The image has been modified from the original by me [Shark](https://twitter.com/sharklatan) 

## Building
Ra1nKVM can be built on most Linux distributions. Ubuntu is the only one tested.
Building Ra1nKVM requires ```makeself``` and ```make```. Install both from your package manager to compile, and copy /usr/bin/makeself to /usr/bin/makeself.sh.
To build Ra1nKVM.run, simply use ```make ra1nkvm.run```.
